 # odin-recipes
 My first project
 In this project I created a website with 3 different recipes for steaks.
 I used the following tags: headings, links, images, lists
 I used level1 headings for the name of the recipes, the description, ingredients and steps were all level2 headings.
 I used relative links for the recipes in my index.html file to be able to reach them from my home page.
 Every recipe file has an image link which was copied from Google.
 Used unordered lists for ingredients and ordered lists for steps in all files.
 In the final step I made an unordered list for the recipe links in index.html.
