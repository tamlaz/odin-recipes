  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a wonderful steak dish that was prepared for me when I lived in Argentina.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Argentinean</em>steak dish</strong>is quite popular in various restaurants around Buenos Aires.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup red wine</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 sprig fresh rosemary</li>
    <li>4 New York strip steaks, cut <strong>1-inch</strong>thick</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Combine the red wine, salt and rosemary in a small bowl. Let stand at room temperature for 2 to 3 hours.</li>
    <li>Heat a large griddle or cast-iron skillet over high heat. Place the steaks on the hot pan, and cook for about 8 minutes per side, or to desired degree of doneness. The internal temperature should be at least 145 degrees F (62 degrees C) for medium rare.</li>
    <li>Pour in the wine mixture, and allow it to boil for a minute. Serve steaks with sauce on a deep platter.</li>
  </ol>
